     * there is a list of sleep modes which explains which clocks and
     * wake up sources are available in which sleep modus.
     *
     * In the avr/sleep.h file, the call names of these sleep modus are to be found:

     *     SLEEP_MODE_IDLE         -the least power savings
     *     SLEEP_MODE_ADC
     *     SLEEP_MODE_PWR_SAVE
